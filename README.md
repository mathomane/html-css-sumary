FUNCTION OF HTML
It has 3 Web Core Languages:

HTML
	responsible for making up the content of the web.
	has straightforward structure without logic programming logic, loops or functions.
	it is simple to use, even if you misspelled elements, it would just guess what you were trying to say and run the page for you.

TEXT FORMATNG & HTML SYNTAX
It is used to structure websites
It uses tags that are symbolized as greater than and less than to mark different elements. We have 2 types of tags e.g. open tag<> and close tag</> that can be differentiated by a forward slash for close tag.
Tags work together to define elements that are like packages containing content.
HTML HEADLINES
Webpages contains various headlines, titles and subheadings which are normally divided into small chunks. Elements used for marking up headlines are in 6 different types such as: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. 
	Each headline has their own visual effect. Selecting the appropriate level is easy.
For example: <h1> Welcome to the Jungle</h1> h1 is for the entire article of the article or web.
	H2 is the subtitle that is usually smaller and longer than the main title.
For example: <h2> Law of the jungle, survival of the fittest</h2> The choice of headline level is based on its meaning.
