What is HTML?

HTML is designed to structure and bridge the content between the human computer languages it is also a channel used to serve different types of content such as: videos, audios, words, images, forms and interactive experience.

FUNCTION OF HTML
It has 3 Web Core Languages:

HTML
* responsible for making up the content of the web.
* has straightforward structure without logic programming logic, loops or functions.
* it is simple to use, even if you misspelled elements, it would just guess what you were trying to say and run the page for you.
  
CSS
*	styling of the web
*	responsible for how the web looks for example: colours, fonts and sizes.
*	adding animations and interactions
  
JavaScript
*	Allows one to create and add interactives stuff.
*	It is behind the fancy and complex interface on the web.
*	It is a bit fragile, unlike HTML when you misspelled an element it does not even try to figure out what you were trying to say. It wonâ€™t run the page.
  
# TEXT FORMATNG & HTML SYNTAX

It is used to structure websites
It uses tags that are symbolized as greater than and less than to mark different elements. We have 2 types of tags e.g. open tag `<>` and close tag `</>` that can be differentiated by a forward slash for close tag.
Tags work together to define elements that are like packages containing contentz

HTML HEADLINES

Webpages contains various headlines, titles and subheadings which are normally divided into small chunks. Elements used for marking up headlines are in 6 different types such as: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6`. 

For example:

`<h1>` Welcome to the Jungle `</h1>`, h1 is for the entire article of the article or web.
*	H2 is the subtitle that is usually smaller and longer than the main title.
  
For example: `<h2>` Law of the jungle, survival of the fittest `</h2>`, The choice of headline level is based on its meaning.

HTML Bold and Italics

* it has four related elements, 2 for bold and another 2 for italics.
Reasons for using italics in some scenarios is to make a string point and in some it is because the word emphasized is the title or the main topic.


* `<i>` to apply visual italics.
* `<em>` to emphasize

*they appear the same but have different meanings.

The same as italics, there are also 2 elements used to emphasize or make something BOLD in HTML.
*first element is <strong> used to show important words, seriousness, or and urgency. It adds meaning to the text.
*`<b>` generic and neutral. 
     does not carry any specific meaning.
     does not imply any alternative voice or words.

HTML Lists

HTML lists are divided into 3 categories: unordered list, ordered list, and definition list.
* Ordered list: they are normally used for recipes and following steps.
* For example: steps to follow when making banana bread.
* they are identified with an `<ol>` element as each step I marked with `<li>` element.
* Unordered list: they have no particular order
* For example: giving a list of ingredients to buy for making banana bread.
* they are identified with `<ul>` element,followed by each step marked with `<li>` element.

Definition list: they are not like `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
* normally used when creating list that rembles akey value pair in computer science.
* instead of just items, first term then corresponding description.
* `<dt>` stands for defining term.
* `<dd>` tag stands for description.
* each term is marked with `<dd>` tag or element then the entire lost is wrapped with a `<dt>` tag..
HTML Quotes

HTML has different types of quotes such as: Using quotes and cite block elements, Using block quotes, and Using inline quotes.

Using quotes and cite block: `<cite>` and `<block>` serve semantic purpose.
* informs other computers.
* provide convenient way to apply custom styling.

Using block quotes in context: elements should be nested with each other in a way that makes sense.
* include any element within the block quote.
* one can even put list or headlines.
  
#Using inline quotes: unlike block quotes, they appear within the texts.
* use `<q>` element in HTML question.
* Using `<q>` element makes browser autprovide appropriate quote mark.
* comparing block quote element with `<q>` element is a good example for understanding HTML.
* HTML elements like, `<strong>`, `<b>`, `<i>` and `<em>` are inline, they are meant to wrap around text phrases that are inline with each other content.
* their purpose is similar with the `<q>` element.

Using date elements a few time elements

To specify the accurate date and time in a language that a computer can understand.
* `<time.datime="2024-01-22"> January1,2022 </time>`.
* it starts with a year 4 digits followed by the month 2 digits and lastly the day also 2 digits

* on time elements,time is not necessary spelled ou on the website
* it uses time phases like 2 hours ago or 11 minutes ago
* but behind the scenes we still need to use a language that the computer understands.
* the time macine referes 24 hours format which inclued seconds and fractions
For example: 15:45, which means 3:45 PM it uses five hour behind the Greenwhich Mean Time

# Capabilities

Troubleshooting and Debuging

Troubleshooting and debuging in HTML comes with accessing developer tools. to do so you will have to right click on the page that you're in, then select inspect.
inspect has three sectons which are:

1. HTML on the left
2. CSS on the middle
3. More options on the right

HTML Attributes

HTML attributes add power to any element. There are four highly useful global attributes in HTMLthat work universaly. Class attributes is the most commonly used. It allows any elements which can be styled with the use of CSS for all lements that share the class.

Class and ID attributes

Known as on of the porpular attributes, similar to the class attribute. 
* they can be used for targeting CSS which can sometimes cause issues.
* they come in handy when addresing specific elements in Javascript or targeted links.
* its uniqueness ensures that there will always be one element with ID.
* CLASS and ID attributes nprovide a way to name HTML elements and reference them in onother parts of code stack.

ARIA ROLES

ARIA roles are exxtra attributs added ito HTML to make more meaningful and also assists the browser to understand what they representing.

Web or online accessibility image

ARIA Roles come in handy in providing essential information to assistive technologies like: screen readers, braille display, and magnifiers to ensure the website is fully accessible.
It came about when web began replacing native applications. 

Using the browser accessibility tree

* it is like a companion DOM tree that the browsr create from the website content.
* DOM tree represents the  structure of HTML
* accessibility tree is known or desinged sor assistive devices like screen readers.
* povides better experience to the user.
* it can however results or lead to poor experince e.g. letter "hello" be read out loud individually. To improve all this one can use ARIA
* aad aria label to HTML to specify the text that the screen reader will read.
* set ARIA label to "hello wold"
* hide individual letters by enclosing them with `<div>` element
* set ARIA hiddeen attribute to true.

~ Formatting HTML ~

 Formating HTML includes:
 
 1. Working with extra spaces
 2. Working with comments
 3. Working with uper and lowercases
 4. Working with long and short elements
 5. Working with self- closing elements

It has always been said in the beginning that HTML does not pay much attentions to spaces, tabs or line braeks, however now there are couple of exceptions.

 ~ How to use comments in HTML ~

According to programmers, they enhance code readability by adding comments that explain its purpose. In HTML, comments are inserted by typing `<!--` at the start and `-->` at the end. These comments are disregarded by the browser. Code editors such as Notepad++ can display commented code or remarks in a grayed-out fashion, which proves to be quite handy. This feature helps us quickly identify when code is commented out and prevents any confusion when it does not function as expected.

For example, this is how a comment looks like in HTML:

```html``
`<!-- This is a comment -->`

The HTML Upper- and Lowercase Debate:

In the history of HTML, there was a shift from capitalizing all elements to using lowercase letters as the norm. Despite the evolution, browser support remains unaffected. Both old and new websites coexist with different letter case choices, showcasing that browsers handle it seamlessly. Although personal preferences vary, the contemporary practice leans towards using lowercase for better readability.

The Evolution of HTML Element Length:

HTML elements vary in length, with some like `<p>` or `<i>` being short, and others like ``<article>`` or ``<video>`` being longer. This difference originated from the early days of HTML when file size optimization was crucial due to limited computer resources. With advancements in technology and increased memory, the focus shifted to prioritizing code readability. Newer HTML elements now use complete words for better human understanding. Element length can serve as a clue to its historical timeline, indicating changes over time.

The Evolution of HTML Tag Formatting:

In HTML, most elements have both opening and closing tags, while some older ones lacked closing tags initially. For instance, the `<img>` element in the 90s didn't require a closing tag. However, the practice evolved, and adding a slash at the end became standard to self-close elements. Although this convention persisted for years, around 2010, its importance waned as browsers adapted to various formatting styles. Ultimately, the choice of including the closing slash is left to the developer's discretion.

# HTML Navigation and Linking

Working with Links:
  * Use the A element (anchor) to create links.
  * Add an href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes.
  * "href" stands for Hypertext Reference.
* Linking Text and Images:
  * Place text or images between the opening and closing A tags to make them clickable.
* Link Placement:
  * A element is inline and can be used within paragraphs or other text.
* Versatility of URLs:
  * URLs can be simple (e.g., HTTPS://example.com) or more complex.
  * Absolute URLs point to precise locations on the web.
  * Include HTTP or HTTPS, standing for Hypertext Transport Protocol, in absolute URLs.
* HTTPS for Security:
  * HTTPS indicates a secure connection.
  * Experts recommend using HTTPS for enhanced security.
  * Modern browsers automatically add HTTPS:// when typing a URL.

HTML URL Pathway

* Absolute vs. Relative URLs:
  * Absolute URLs point to specific web locations.
  * Relative URLs are used for links within the same site/domain.
* Context of Usage:
  * Example scenario: developing a website locally before deployment.
  * Avoiding issues with absolute URLs trying to access the live site during development.
* Importance of Relative URLs:
  * Allow links to adapt to different environments (e.g., local development, testing servers).
  * Useful for referencing various file types, not just for linking with the A element.
 
# HTML Workinh with Graphics and Images
Adding an image to webpage, we use image element that is written as `<img>`.
Addding an image includes four attributes 
1. source attribute (src)-> it tells the browser which image file to upload.
2. alt attribute (alt)-> provides txt description of image.
3. width and height attribute-> determine the size.

in HTML it does not matter wether the height or the width is specified first, the order of the attribute can be whatever you prefer.

IMAGE FORMATS

There are four main image fomarts used on the web which are:
1. GIF
   * good for compressing illustrations that have larger areas of the same color.
   * if falls short when it comes to photographs.
   * it only supports 256 colors with the images looking pixaleted

2. SVG
   * perfect fo logos, icons and other type of illustrators.
   * vector file that contains instructions to drawing.
   * can be scaled to any size without losing quality.
   * programming laguage for graphics
   * can be exported

3. JPG
   * popular choice for compressing photographs
   * half compessed JPG can slow down the speed of loading in a web
     
4. PNG
  * works well when needing tranparency in photographs
  * outperforms GIF and JPG

RESPONSIVE IMAGES
With HTML we can deliver different image files to screens of different size. Wecan also create multiple image files and include them as option in HTML code.

# WORKING WITH MEDIA

* audio element is idifferernt from the image element, it has bothe openimg and closing tag
* has more power and flexibility
* there is an option to create your own control using JS and HTML media element API
* loops can also be used as media element, it will make the audio repeat from the start till the finish
* autoplay can aotomatically play audio as soon as the page loads
* MP3 are supported in modern browsers

WORKING WITH VIDEO

* Like audio element, video element also has opening and closing tag
* to display video, we use the source attribute to specify video file
* there are different codes that can be used to encide video files
* internet videos use a mechanism to cmpress all the adte into a small package.

WOKING WITH SUBTITLES AND CAPTIONS
  Working with video element and track element
* track element adds functionality to video players
* allows viewers to togglecaption on and off
* to display caption, insert track element within the video element
* use the source attribute to specify the file

EMBEDDING MEDIA VIA IFRAMES

Embedding refers to taking content from one site and placing it within the middle of another site's page.

WORKING WITH IFRAMES ELEMENT

Using content managemnt system (CMS) that has been set up by oter elements, you may not be able to copy and paste random embed codes from other websites.
CMS has a spcific way to allow URLS OR SHOTCODE FROM TRUSTED SOURCES
Security aspects elated to iframe elements should be considered when building website.

# HTML CONTENT IDENTIFICATION

HTML Lanuage Support

HTML has tool to indentify the language of your website. Search engines will understand which language
the website is in and also the spellcheckers will provide appropriate dictionaries.

The lang Attribute
Lang attribute is udes to specify the language of a website. If the whole website is in one language, it is quite simple.
To specify this you can use "en-US" in the land attribute which means U.S English. There is also "en-GB" for English in Great Britain.
It is also important to specify on the cintent direction.
Most languages flow from left to right horizontally but some flow from right to left.
